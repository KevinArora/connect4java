    Technologies used:
        Java

    Process/Aproach
        I primarily wanted to have a functional game in the command line before moving
        to something more visual.

    Unsolved problems
        completely refactoring for OOP principles.
        Possibly move to better animating software.

        finding easy and light solutions for tracking player turns and actions.
